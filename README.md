## Project Description 📜

**Youth Can** is a landing page for a youth empowerment initiative, crafted to introduce the platform's goals in a clear and engaging way. The project focuses on a clean, professional, and fully responsive design to ensure an optimal user experience across all devices.

## Project Purpose 📖

For my first big project at the **Brainster** front-end academy, I built Youth Can. This landing page isn't just about promoting a youth empowerment initiative; it’s a direct reflection of what I've learned. It gave me a chance to build a professional, fully responsive site from scratch, incorporating things like form validation and interactive elements. I used a stack of modern web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap** to get it done, and it really shows my progress and what I’m capable of after just the first part of the program.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts seamlessly to any screen, providing a perfect viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Testimonial Carousel**: A dynamic carousel, built with **Bootstrap**, showcases user testimonials.
- **Form Validation**: Simple **JavaScript** ensures a smooth and effective form-filling process for users.
- **CSS** and **Bootstrap**: The project uses **CSS** for organized, efficient styling and **Bootstrap** to power key components like the testimonial carousel.
- **Fully Accessible**: The landing page is designed to be user-friendly and accessible across a wide range of devices and browsers.

## Development Process

I used a structured **Git workflow** to build this project. Here’s a quick overview of my process:

- I started by setting up a new repository and the basic file structure.
- For each new feature—like the testimonial carousel, form validation, or animations—I created a separate branch. This allowed me to work on each part of the project independently without affecting other code.
- OOnce a feature was complete and tested, I merged its branch into the main `dev` branch.
- Finally, after confirming that everything was working together smoothly in the `dev` branch, I merged it into the `main` branch for the final release.

For this project, I relied on **Git** for version control to effectively manage all the changes I made. To track my progress and collaborate on the code, I used **GitLab** for hosting the repository and its features for collaboration. This workflow allowed me to keep the project organized, track every change, and ensure a smooth development process.
